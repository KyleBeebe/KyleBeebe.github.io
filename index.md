    The is an educational raytracer that I've been extending with extra features and functionality. Full path tracing has been implemented with support for diffuse, specular, and dielectric materials. The most recent addition was the implmentation of a volumentric rendering integrator. It allows the rendering of homogeneous mediums such as environmental fog.

    This was created in Unity3D to show case some of the game programming techniques developed in CMSC 425 at UMD. 
    It was create as a team of three. All scripts were created using C#. The premise is a first person shooter on a space ship fighting 
    robots. The main gimmicks were the cubic Bezier curve based grappling hook, the centrifuge style level that allowed traversal along the inside walls, and the few destructible items within the environment.
