    This was created in Unity3D to show case some of the game programming techniques developed in CMSC 425 at UMD. 
    It was create as a team of three. All scripts were created using C#. The premise is a first person shooter on a space ship fighting 
    robots. The main gimmicks were the Bezier curve based grappling hook and the centrifuge style level that allowed traversal along the       inside walls.
